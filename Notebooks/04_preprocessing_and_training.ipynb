    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

But this is  a common task so there's a built in function in `sklearn`. This is [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html).\n",
    "This takes the pipeline object, in fact it takes anything with a `.fit()` and `.predict()` method. In simple cases with no feature selection or imputation or feature scaling etc. you may see the classifier or regressor object itself directly passed into `GridSearchCV`. The other key input is the parameters and values to search over. Optional parameters include the cross-validation strategy and number of CPUs to use."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "To establish a baseline for model performance, we used the average ski ticket price of about 63.81 as a constant predictor for all observations. This provided a simple reference point to evaluate how much better, or not, more sophisticated models perform. Using the average price leads to an expected error of about $19 on the test set. By that, we can judge that any model with a higher error than this is likely not worth using. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then built a linear regression model to improve upon the baseline. Before fitting, we handled missing values by testing both mean and median imputation strategies, which produced nearly identical values and an expected error of about $9. I then wanted to see how many features and which ones would have the most predictive power. We ended up with 8 important features to train on that included vertical drop, snow making coverage, total chairs, fast quads, runs, longest run, trams, and skiable terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "During cross-validation, the linear regression model achieved a mean R2 score of 0.63 (+-19), and the performance on the test set was consistent with this estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I evaluated a random forest regressor to see if a non-linear model could outperform linear regression. I used a pipeline that included missing value imputation, optional scaling, and the random forest model. A grid search was conducted over the number of trees, whether to scale the features, and the imputation strategy. The best-performing configuration used 42 trees, median imputation, and no scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best model achieved a mean R2 of 0.71 across 5-fold cross-validation, with a low standard deviation, about 0.07, indication stable performance. This result slightly exceeded the linear model’s cross-validated score. The dominant features included fast quads, runs, snow making, and vertical drop, which overlapped significantly with the linear model, adding confidence in their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test performance was consistent with these cross-validation results, supporting the model’s ability to generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model I am going to move forward with is the random forest regressor model because the random forest model has a lower cross-validation mean absolute error by almost $1 and exhibits less variability. These results show that not only does the random forest model make more accurate predictions but also generalizes more reliably than the linear regression model."
